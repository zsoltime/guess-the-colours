# Day 4 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

This is the fourth day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge), bringing you a CSS colour game.

Don't you like CSS colour names? Some of them are so cute; just think of papayawhip, peachpuff or cornsilk. Have you ever heard about any of these? This game is for you then.

The rules are simple. You should find the colours by their name before you run out of time.

## User Stories

- [x] There are certain levels and the game is getting more and more difficult by reaching higher levels
- [x] I have lives, so I can make a few mistakes
- [x] There is a countdown timer
- [x] I get a score based on the time and correct answers
- [x] I can see my best score
- [ ] I can share my result(s) on Twitter

## Next Steps

I wanted to display the name of the colours when clicked on the wrong one, I hope I can add that later (with the Tweet button). We all know that means there is no chance, but... :)
